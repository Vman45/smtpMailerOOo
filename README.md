**This extension is under development and is not yet available ... Thank you for your patience.**

What remains to be done:

- Rewriting of mailmerge.py (to be compatible with: SSL and StartTLS, OAuth2 authentication... ie: with Mozilla IspBD technology)
- Write an Wizard using Mozilla IspDB technology able to find the correct configuration working with mailmerge.py.
- Rewriting of Mailer Dialog.py in a Mailer Wizard dialog.
